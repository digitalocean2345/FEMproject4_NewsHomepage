## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Main learning was the use of flexbox, including wrap property to get the desired style.
- The toggle effect is not applied as javascript is yet to be learnt.
- a sample file is also made to get the same result with css grid.
